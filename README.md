## Why Learn DSA?
Learning Data Structures and Algorithms is important because:
1. **Optimized Solutions**: DSA helps in designing solutions that are not only efficient but also scalable.
2. **Interview Preparation**: Most technical interviews are heavily based on DSA concepts.
3. **Problem-Solving Skills**: It enhances your logical thinking and analytical abilities.
4. **Real-World Applications**: Most of the systems, applications, and technologies are built on efficient data structures and algorithms.
